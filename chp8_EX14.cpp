- Can we declare a non-reference function argument const (e.g., void f(const int);)? 

    - What might that mean? 
    - Why might we want to do that? 
    - Why donâ€™t people do that often? 


- Try it:
    write a couple of small programs to see what works.

//     Yes, this can be done, but isn't really used too often (it has some
//     niche cases though).

//     Declaring your function paramter const will make it to where it can't be 
//     changed or altered, if you do within the code, you'll get an error.

//     You'd want to do it if you want to make sure that, that the function
//     paramter can't be changed within the code.

//     People don't do this often because, usually when you use a function parameter,
//     you want to do somthing with it (math, logic, etc.), and this usually 
//     requires the function parameter to be changed or altered in some way.
